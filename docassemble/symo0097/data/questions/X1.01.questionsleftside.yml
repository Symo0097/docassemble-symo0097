question: Written Contract
subquestion: |
  A 'written contract' can mean a formal contract document.
  It can also mean any emails, texts or messages you send
  or receive about the contract.
  If your
  messages contain information about:

  - what work was meant to be done
  - how much was going to be paid for that work
  - who was going to do the work and who was going to pay

  Then those messages may be enough to be a 'written contract'.

  - Do you or the other person have a 'written contract'?: MJFwritten_contract
